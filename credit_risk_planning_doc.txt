Credit Risk Indicator

Goal: Binary classification, default or not
[Note: Default == failure to repay a loan according to terms of agreement in promissory note]


- Over Leverage: debt to assets ratio (if debt is bigger than assets you fucked)
-- can estimate assets (based on data that I have)
- Low Personal EBITDA: Income - Cost_of_Living_for_Area
- Interest Coverage Ratio: interest payments / net income
- How much of a persons income is going towards paying debt
- Annuity: play around with length to change the payments without changing interest rate (look @ monthly income & expenses to determine max monthly payment without defaulting)
-- Max monthly payment is required info in loan application (income & current debt payments)
-- can estimate cost of living based on where they live and income level
- Context leverage (in financial markets): using debt to increase risk. i.e. borrow money and put it into a stock, if it goes down need to pay lender and have loss on stock.

- Best indicator of credit default risk is consumer credit history 
- income is variable depending on age (too young == no income, too old == retirement_
- Revolving Credit (i.e. credit card, line of credit, etc.) is riskier
- Installment Credit (i.e loan of fixed amount: repayment scheduled over clearly defined payment schedule [borrow amount will not change over time]) - is less risky

-portion of payments that goes towards interest vs. principal loan
-- paying off only interest can make loan cost more 
- ratio at enddate of principal:interest
-- what the ratio of principal:interest_debt is at the end of loan
-- how long it took to pay down the loan
- cost_goods by lifetime_servicing
-- downpayment (credit - price_of_goods)
- how loans have been paid back 
-- how much of loans have been paid back, not how many have been taken
-- how many loans have been received, and how many have been paid back

- which metrics do people use thta shouldn't be in there

Dataset Notes:
App Test/ Train:
- cars depreciate by 14%/year on average [form: 
- 28/36 rule: https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-much-house-can-i-afford/
-- calculate cost of living using 28% of household expenses, with a percentage modifier for city rating, plus credit card data (better to be too high than too low)
- could calculate cost of living as 28% of household income + (1 to 3% region rating modifier)
- region rating is higher when population is higher too


Previous app risk factor:
- AMT_credit is amount recieved in prev_app (debt)
- FLAG_LAST_APPL_PER_CONTRACT flag if last application for prev. contract, take out non-flags to ensure there was only one

Installment payment risk factor:
- difference b/w day-to-pay and day-paid: (dtp - dp)
- difference b/w amount-owed and amount-paid: (ao - ap)


DataSet Info:
SK_ID_CURR == ID of loan in sample (note: in bureau, one person can have multiple bureau_ids)
TARGET == Target Variable (1 - client w/ payment difficultes they had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of loan in our smaple; 0 - all other cases)
